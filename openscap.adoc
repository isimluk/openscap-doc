 * A tool (to verify that a system conforms to a standard)
 * Satellite Server 5.5 and later use OpenSCAP as an auditing feature
 * SCAP content

== Creating your own content

You can generate your own SCAP content if you have an understanding of at least XCCDF or OVAL. XCCDF content is also
frequently published online under open source licenses, and you can customize this content to suit your needs instead.
